When they first met, they were both in poor states of mind. They both thought that the other was going to be another person who had brushed past their shoulder, not knowing that their affinity had started.

Liang Xinhe: “So I press down the snow in my heart time and time again, as they are too white, too close to spring.”

Ning Xi: “These emotional affairs of the mortal world flash by like a sparrow suddenly swooping past.”

    description: `"When Jiang Yusheng was young, she met Bo Su, who was always aloof and unattainable, like the moon on a snowy peak. Everyone said the Bo family girl was cold-blooded, that Bo Su’s name symbolized indifference and heartlessness. But Jiang Yusheng refused to believe it. Until one day, after a long and desperate pursuit, Bo Su stood among a glamorous crowd, frowned, and coldly said, ‘I don’t know her,’ shattering all of Jiang Yusheng’s illusions. Abandoned in the wind and snow, she was left to fend for herself.

Years later, they meet again. Jiang Yusheng no longer cares about the past, but Bo Su, in the deep, rainy night, kisses her and asks, ‘What are we now?’ No one understands why the usually composed and responsible young mistress of her Beicheng family would ruin her own future, ignoring all rumors, to be infatuated with an obscure restaurant owner on a small island.

Only Bo Su knows: Jiang Yusheng was the moonlight she couldn’t grasp at eighteen, the dream she couldn’t hold onto. At thirty, she found her way back, with a mark etched on her heart.

‘Life is a wilderness. May we always have the courage to stray from the path. Chase the wind, follow the moon, and fear not the spring mountains.’`

Years later, they unexpectedly reunite. After sealing a business deal, the front desk manager asks Fu Sitian, ‘Boss, were you close with President Shi before?’ Fu Sitian, lost in thought as she watches Shi Yi leave, smiles and replies, ‘In college, we were very close. So close that I knew every mole on her body.’

In the elevator, Shi Yi is also deep in thought. A friend asks, ‘What are you thinking about?’ Shi Yi smirks coldly, ‘I’m thinking, the little white rabbit has grown into a big white rabbit. I wonder if it’s still as delicious.’

From school to society, from past to future, thank you for being the only star in my dim life. From now on, every day is filled with light.`

Only one day, the eldest young lady suddenly changed her temper. She would ask her if something hurts, if she needed medicine, as if she was her own lapdog.

Wei Qingyu thought that the young lady had come up with some tricks to harm her, so she vigilantly kept a distance from her.

But later, Wei Qingyu couldn’t help but deal with delinquents who were causing trouble for Ji Xiao, helped her with her homework to get into the same university as her, and rescued her from the burning house…

Wei Qingyu stood in the pitch-dark room, gazing at the peacefully sleeping Ji Xiao, finally understanding why Ji Xiao was mean to her.

Outside her ex-girlfriend’s wedding, a poised and elegant woman she has met a few times sits beside her and calmly asks, “Want to be with me?” Jiang Zhaoxue, eyes red, responds, “What?” The woman, with features as delicate as a painting, speaks each word with precision: “Don’t you want to prove yourself? I have money, looks, and status. I’d be a marriage partner many would envy.” Jiang Zhaoxue, bewildered, asks, “But what’s in it for you?” The woman, with a faint smile, wipes away her tears and says, “It’s just an act, don’t worry.” She speaks lightly, “I just need a marriage partner, and we can both get what we need.

Later, Jiang Zhaoxue suspects that her life is a web meticulously woven by Cen Lubai. But Cen Lubai says, “The thread to close the net is in your hands. You are free, and I am the one under your control.” She holds her hand, tempting her: “Possess me, or sink me to the bottom of the sea.”

‘Nothing ever happens by coincidence; it’s always been me, plotting and scheming.’`

Her sense of existence was so diminished to the point that even if someone had accidentally bumped into her, that person might not even realise they bumped into someone.

Her life was simply tragic and absurd.

Until one day, a “male protagonist halo” crashed onto her head, and her life flipped upside down. Along with it, came something called a system. The system requested for her to immediately become a protagonist, doing everything the male lead should do and making it a perfect world.

Lu Zhi Wei: ?

Lu Zhi Wei: Ridiculous, I’m a woman!

System that refuses to listen: I don’t care. If the mission isn’t completed, I’ll give you an electric shock.

Lu Zhi Wei who’s fearful of pain: Okay bro, no problem bro.

But as the missions went on, they discovered something was wrong.

The female lead, she——

Completely! Didn’t! Follow! The! Script!

System: ?

Optimistic Lu Zhi Wei: Look on the bright side. I can even become the male lead, so what if the female lead is a bit rebellious?

System: I can’t bloody look on the bright side……

This kind of female lead with incredible dodging skills was too ridiculous!!

In the end, the rebellious and ridiculous female lead finally followed a plot point. She fell in love with the “male lead”.`

In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told in The Hobbit.

In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.

The inspiration for the upcoming original series on Prime Video, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.

One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.

Frodo and his Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in a battle in the Mines of Moria. And Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the company was attacked by Orcs. Now they continue the journey alone down the great River Anduin—alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go.

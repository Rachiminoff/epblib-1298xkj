    content: `The truth
This is who I truly am — look closely
The scars I hid, I stubbornly avoided 
Misunderstandings that passed me by 
I denied them, and I fought them 
My heart and mind in pain and conflict 
I wasn’t honest, and I shut my heart away 
I hid away, and left you all behind 

Wounded and broken to pieces, and there’s no undoing what’s been done 
But the cracks left a mark so beautiful 
I embraced and claimed both light and darkness as my own 
Now the voice is a melody, born from the heart’s pure truth 
Why did I silence the mind's cry back then?
I poured light into the darkness I held inside 
Open your heart, reveal the voice you've kept hidden 
The song we sought — its melody is now real 

I won’t stay silent — I’ll move forward and fight! 
I won’t think I’m alone anymore! 
We listened to the darkness, and it drove us apart 
Yet in spite of it all, here we are — together again! 
We were scared for a moment, we deceived ourselves 
We weren’t perfect, but we learned 
We dreamed, we fought — and now we have a vow
Even if fire stands in the way, I won’t ever leave your side! 

Wounded and broken to pieces, and there’s no undoing what’s been done 
But the cracks left a mark so beautiful 
I embraced and claimed both light and darkness as my own 
Now the voice is a melody, born from the heart’s pure truth 
Why did I silence the mind's cry back then?
Let the light pour into the darkness we carry
Open your heart, reveal the voice you've kept hidden 
The courage within you is now a melody — genuine and real! 

Wounded and broken to pieces, and there’s no undoing what’s been done 
But the cracks left a mark so beautiful 
I embraced and claimed both light and darkness as my own 
Now the voice is a melody, born from the heart’s pure truth 
Why did I silence the mind's cry back then?
Let the light pour into the darkness we carry
Open your heart, reveal the voice you've kept hidden 
The courage within you is now a melody — genuine and real! 

Now the voice is a melody, born from the heart’s pure truth 
The courage within you is now a melody — genuine and real! 
Truth alone remains — and it made our voices one 
The light that shines in darkness is a melody, real and true

    content: `I just hid away, kept quiet
My voice once sang but faltered, fading like it vanished
I smiled while drowning inside
And you were the one who saved me
Even when you thought I was worthless
The things I wished to change — I could
If only you were by my side

It feels like freedom when you’re here with me
It feels like freedom every time we talk
No secrets left unspoken
No more fear, no more pain in my heart
Even when I suffer, it feels like you understand
We can face the past we tried to escape
Or finally leave it all behind

We could be free...
Free...
Let’s face the fears that haunt us
Or finally leave it all behind

Oh, my life — full of pain
What once was hope is now only rage
But the shadows I kept deep inside
You charged at without fear
You awakened a soul asleep in its hate

Like a war within me — monster and human clashing
Voices screaming inside my head
But they all fall silent when you’re here
My heart grows still
It’s wrong, I know — but still, it’s you I seek

It feels like freedom when you’re here with me
It feels like freedom when you speak to me
Let’s face the fears we used to flee from
Or finally leave it all behind

We could be free!
Free!
Leave behind the pain we’ve carried

Whoa—come with me
Free! Free!
Let go of the suffering
Free! Free!

Even when I hid, you saw through me
You changed the sound of my voice
Let’s face the fears we once ran from
And leave behind all we’ve been through
